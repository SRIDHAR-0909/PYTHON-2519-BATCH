========

-> Write Python Code 

    -> Script Mode (100%)

        -> Using code editor 

    -> Command Line / Interactive Mode (Quick Checks) 

        -> Directly executing code on python Interpreter using 
            CLI (Command Line Interface)

    -> Syntax - Rules and guidelines 

    -> print(hello world) -- issue
    -> print(9) -- No issue

    -> 9 is literal number, it doesn't need to be defined before hand
    -> hello world is a text, which needs to be represented in single
    or double quotes

        -> print(hello world) Wrong Syntax
        -> print('hello world') Correct Syntax
    
    -> Like English has 26 alphabets, which is basis for forming 
        words and sentences
    
    -> Python has same concept, which are called as Keywords

        -> keywords + syntax = program / app

    -> import is a keyword --> imports module --> module is a .py file
